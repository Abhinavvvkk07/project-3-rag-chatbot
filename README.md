# Project 3 - RAG based Chatbot

Please refer to this file and the template if you have any questions! 

## Project Description

In this project, you will be given a PDF of a stock market related book. The goal is for you to build a chatbot that uses RAG to get any relevant information about stocks, etc, directly from this textbook.

## The dataset (already imported in template)

The dataset is found in this template as a PDF. Please refer to that moving forward! 

## Submission Criteria 

As you have done for the first and seond projecs, please submit the project via GitHub. Much like for project 2, please instead submit to the assignment on google classroom with your GitHub username and commit ID. As far as grading criteria goes, we will test out your Chatbot/Vector DB to see how accurate the chatbot will be at referencing the textbook. 

**This project will be due April 2nd!** 

## Tips and last remarks 

- Please use the template, it has a lot of helpful resources for you!
- As alwayas, have fun while learning along the way :). Knowing RAG is a must in today's AI/ML society and this project will give you the tools to get a good start!
